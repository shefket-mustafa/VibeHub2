## 🔒 Authentication Flow

1. User registers or logs in  
2. Server validates credentials and creates a JWT  
3. JWT is sent back and stored in **localStorage**  
4. API requests include JWT in the `Authorization` header  
5. Middleware verifies the token before processing requests  

---

## 🔑 Forgot & Reset Password Flow (EmailJS)

1. User enters email on the **Forgot Password** page  
2. Server verifies the user and generates a short-lived JWT reset token (15 min)  
3. EmailJS sends a reset email containing a secure link:
4. User clicks the link → lands on the **Reset Password** page  
5. User enters new password → backend verifies token and updates password
